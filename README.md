projectx server back up
projectx is trying to develop a system could monitor temperature, humidity and motion inside a certain area like a house.
we use zigbee wireless communication protocal to connect sensors and raspberry pi to collect data from several sensors and upload thoes data to server, user can read those data realtime from their smartphone(ios for now) or webpage. 

server will collect the right data from raspberry pi and store those data in database, and show thoes data when requested.
